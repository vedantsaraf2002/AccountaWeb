DIGINET DATA SYSTEM also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href="https://web.accounta.app/">https://web.accounta.app/</a> blog posts. DIGINET DATA SYSTEM only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
